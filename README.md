# GuessTheColor
## Hue Match Game

This game is played by selecting the color on the right that matches the swatch on the left.  It was inspired by the board game, [Hues and Cues](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5390676/hues-and-cues).

It has two modes
* Calm Mode: a user can play license free calm music and allows matching but penalizes for incorrect guesses by ending the streak.  
* Choas Mode: a user matches as many colors as possible in a set amount of time without penalty for incorrect guessing.
